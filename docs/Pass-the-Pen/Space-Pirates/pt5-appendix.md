## PASS THE PEN - CHARACTERS

YOU! Yes, you! We need character fillouts. Ones we’ve already spoken about, and any new ones you might think about - even if they aren’t ready to be involved in the book just yet! We’d like a format of (and all or even just one trait is perfect!)
You can either
Create a new character
Amend a new character (give them more features)
Criticise a character (this could be better, this character could be improved, etc)

We will scrape everything that comes out and tidy it up - using the colour scheme of what you’ve edited, and who has edited it, would be fantastic.
Get creative, folks!

NAME
Appearance...e.g. Eyepatch, beard, heart-melting smile, etc.
Personality e.g. INFJ, good/evil chaotic/lawful, 
What they want! E.g. Whatwhat is their object of desire? This is crucial to creating a good story coupled with….
What is their conflict or sacrifice? What do they regret, what must they give up? Every character has a fatal flaw they overcome.
Which leads to...JOURNEY. How may this character trybe triedtrialed to overcome themselves, become bigger, like a PhoenixPheonix in flames?
AND FINALLY...art is welcome! If anyone would like to draw or model these characters, ARTISTS, here you are welcome to do so!
